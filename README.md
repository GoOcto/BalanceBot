# BalanceBot

An Android App that communicates over USB to some hardware that drives the device around while balancing it on two wheels

###Work in Progress

The concept is relatively simple: the code in the Arduino compatible board keeps the bot in balance. The Android app reads gyros and accelerometers and keeps updating the Arduino with the data.

1. Communication step is mostly complete.
2. Arduino code for balancing, needs to be merged into this project.
